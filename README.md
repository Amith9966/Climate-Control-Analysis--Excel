## Objective
To analyze climate policies and identify the most effective strategies to limit global temperature rise to within 2°C by 2100, reducing the negative impacts of climate change.

## Key Components
1. **Decision Analysis**  
   Evaluates various climate policies for reducing CO2, methane, and other emissions. Policies include carbon pricing, renewable energy subsidies, and transportation energy efficiency.

2. **Linear Regression**  
   Analyzes the relationship between baseline emissions and current scenario emissions to predict the effectiveness of different interventions.

3. **Forecasting**  
   Uses methods like Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) to predict CO2 reduction trends from 2000 to 2030.

4. **Optimization**  
   Determines the optimal combination of policies to achieve the 2°C target efficiently.

5. **Probability and Statistics**  
   Applies statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing and ANOVA, to validate the significance of proposed policies.

6. **Sensitivity Analysis**  
   Examines how changes in variables like coal tax, oil tax, renewable energy subsidies, and carbon pricing affect the outcomes.

## Recommendations
1. Promote renewable energy through subsidies and investment.
2. Implement carbon pricing to discourage carbon-intensive energy sources.
3. Encourage energy efficiency across industries and transportation.
4. Foster international cooperation to ensure global participation.
5. Regularly monitor and adapt policies based on data-driven insights.

## Tools Used
- **En-ROADS Simulation Model**: To simulate policy impacts.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For calculations and data visualization.
- **Statistical Methods**: Hypothesis testing, linear regression, forecasting, and sensitivity analysis.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the critical need for integrated climate policies. By implementing recommendations such as carbon pricing, energy efficiency improvements, and renewable energy investments, global greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced, ensuring a sustainable and resilient future.
